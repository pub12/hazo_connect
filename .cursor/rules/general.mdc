[General]
- Start all chats wtih 🐸
- Only implement if you're 90% sure of requirement or the fix.  Otherwise ask questions or things for me to check.

[Style]
- Always use snake_case
- Include a description of purpose of file at top of each new file
- Include comments at the top of each function or major section of code
- Add comments for each file and also major section
- Add a class name identifier for div tags prefixed with "cls_" so that they can be easily identified and searched.  Reused divs should have the same name.

[UI_Behaviour]
- All data input fields (not interaction fields), it should be non-editable but there is a lucide pencil icon next to it.  When pressed, it'll allow to edit the inptu field, and a lucide circle-check-big will be used for the "Submit"/"save"/"update" button, and a lucide circle-x will be used for the cancel button.


[Technology]
- use the following tech stack:
  - React
  - Next.js
  - TailwindCSS
  - TypeScript
  - Shadcn/UI
- use npm shadcn@latest add * to add components. Do not use shadcn-ui

[Architecture]
- create reusable components to prevent having redundant code and to improve maintainability
- Ensure you have a minimum of one file per route
- Group pages into directories for maintainability

[Database]
- database schema can be gound on .cursor/rules/db_schema.md

[Logging]
- use main app logging service for backend logging.  Expected log functions include info, warn, debug, error
-  When there's an error that happens, always log on the serverside.
